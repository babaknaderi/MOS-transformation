# MOS-transformation
Implementation of MOS-transformation to be used with Rank based statistical techniques.

The rank correlation coefficients and the ranked-based statistical tests (as a subset of non-parametric techniques) might 
be misleading when they are applied to subjectively collected opinion scores. Those techniques assume that the data is 
measured at least at an ordinal level and define a sequence of scores to represent a tied rank when they have precisely 
an equal numeric value.

In this paper, we show that the definition of tied rank, as mentioned above, is not suitable for Mean Opinion Scores 
(MOS) and might be misleading conclusions of rank-based statistical techniques. Furthermore, we introduce a method to 
overcome this issue by transforming the MOS values considering their 95% Confidence Intervals. The rank correlation 
coefficients and ranked-based statistical tests can then be safely applied to the transformed values. We also provide 
open-source software packages in different programming languages to utilize the application of our transformation method 
in the quality of experience domain.

## Code
We provide implementation of our transformation method for MATLAB, Python and R.

### MARLAB
Add the directory `src/MATLAB` to your MATLAB search path.
``` MATLAB
mos = [10, 7];
ci = [4, 2];
expected_rank = [1.5,1.5];
new_rank = transform_mos(mos,ci); 
```

### Python
Installation
``` bash
pip install subjective-test
```
Input the corresponding function and use it:

``` python
    from subjective_test.utilities import transform_mos
    
    mos = [10, 6, 5.5]
    ci = [4, 2, 0.2]
    t = transform_mos(mos, ci)
    #  expected_rank = [3, 1.5, 1.5]
```
